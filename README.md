## Online Rugby World Cup Tournament Tracker
### Description
Itâ€™s 2023 and that means another year of the Rugby World Cup. Four years ago, the
Springboks made our country proud and won the tournament and are now back
defending their title. With the inclusion of APIs and the advancement of technology
within the sporting world, Team ScrumPoint has made it their goal to unite rugby fans
to keep up to date with the current season of the Rugby World Cup.
ScrumPoint is a Rugby World Cup web-based Tracker that you will be able to view
all events of the World Cup and see the scores of previous games and the current
game. Users of the app can be in different leagues with their friends, and they will be
able to make predictions for every match which will be scored depending on how
close their prediction was to the actual score, they can also choose a player to
predict the man of the match.
